Venezuela’s Oil Reserves Analysis Dashboard 📊
This data analytics project focusing on the energy sector. Using a dataset covering 23 reservoirs, I designed a comprehensive dashboard to track production capacity and resource distribution in Venezuela.
Key Features: ✅ Real-time Metrics: Tracking the 390.50 Billion total barrels in reserve. ✅ Granular Analysis: Production capacity breakdown by reservoir name and oil grade (Extra Heavy to Light). ✅ Stakeholder Mapping: Visualizing the production sum by major operators.
Tools Used: [pandas(jupyter notebook)/mysql(for analysis and cleaning of data), Power BI / Excel(for building dashboard)]
I’d love to hear your thoughts or feedback on the dashboard design!
